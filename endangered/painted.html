                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The Painted Turtle is Ontario's most common and widely distributed turtle species. It has a smooth, dark carapace (upper shell) with red markings along the margins. The plastron (bottom shell) is yellow with a dark central pattern that varies among individuals. The head, neck, and limbs are dark with yellow stripes.</p>
                
                <p>There are two subspecies in Ontario: the Midland Painted Turtle (Chrysemys picta marginata) and the Western Painted Turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii). They are often seen basking in groups on logs, rocks, or banks and are the turtle most frequently encountered by people.</p>

                <h2>Habitat and Range</h2>
                <p>Painted Turtles inhabit a wide variety of freshwater habitats including lakes, ponds, rivers, marshes, and slow-moving streams across Ontario. They prefer water bodies with soft bottoms, abundant aquatic vegetation, and plenty of basking sites. They are found throughout the province, from southern agricultural areas to northern boreal forests.</p>
                
                <p>These turtles are highly adaptable and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions. They hibernate in mud at the bottom of water bodies during winter, often in groups. Painted Turtles are frequently seen in urban and suburban ponds where other turtle species may be absent.</p>

                <h2>Diet and Behavior</h2>
                <p>Painted Turtles are omnivorous, feeding on aquatic vegetation, algae, insects, crustaceans, small fish, and carrion. They forage primarily during daylight hours, both in water and along the bottom. Their diet varies seasonally and with availability of food items.</p>
                
                <p>They are strong baskers and can often be seen sunning in groups. Breeding occurs in spring and fall, with nesting in late spring to early summer. Females nest in sandy or gravelly areas with good sun exposure, often close to water but sometimes traveling significant distances. Painted Turtles have strong site fidelity and may use the same basking and nesting sites year after year.</p>

                <h2>Threats and Conservation</h2>
                <p>Although still relatively common, Painted Turtles face increasing threats:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Road Mortality:</strong> High mortality when crossing roads, especially nesting females</li>
                    <li><strong>Habitat Loss:</strong> Wetland drainage and shoreline development</li>
                    <li><strong>Nest Predation:</strong> High rates of nest destruction by predators</li>
                    <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Water quality degradation in urban areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Illegal Collection:</strong> Taken for pet trade despite protections</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Conservation efforts focus on habitat protection, road mitigation, public education, and monitoring population trends. As Ontario's most common turtle, they serve as an important indicator of wetland health.</p>

            <section class="info-section">
                <h2>Legal Protection</h2>
                <p>The Painted Turtle is listed as a species of Special Concern under both the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) and Ontario's Endangered Species Act (ESA). This means that while not yet endangered or threatened, it may become so if protective measures are not taken.</p>
                
                <p>It is illegal to hunt, trap, or possess Painted Turtles in Ontario without a specific permit. The species is also protected under Ontario's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. Management plans are being developed to address conservation needs.</p>
