                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The Snapping Turtle is Ontario's largest freshwater turtle, with some individuals reaching over 47 cm in shell length and weighing up to 16 kg. They have a rugged appearance with a large head, long tail with saw-toothed ridges, and powerful jaws. Their carapace (upper shell) is serrated at the rear, and they cannot fully retract their head and limbs into their shell for protection.</p>
                
                <p>Unlike most turtles, Snapping Turtles spend much of their time walking along the bottom of water bodies rather than swimming. They are generally dark in color, ranging from brown to black, which helps them blend into muddy environments.</p>

                <h2>Habitat and Range</h2>
                <p>Snapping Turtles are found throughout Ontario in a variety of freshwater habitats including lakes, ponds, rivers, marshes, and creeks. They prefer slow-moving water with soft bottoms and abundant vegetation. While they are widespread across southern and central Ontario, their populations are declining due to various threats.</p>
                
                <p>These turtles are known to travel significant distances over land, particularly females searching for nesting sites. They hibernate during winter in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, emerging when water temperatures rise in spring.</p>

                <h2>Diet and Behavior</h2>
                <p>Snapping Turtles are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on a wide variety of plants and animals. Their diet includes aquatic vegetation, fish, frogs, snakes, small mammals, birds, crayfish, insects, and carrion. They are primarily nocturnal hunters but may also feed during the day.</p>
                
                <p>Despite their reputation for aggression, Snapping Turtles are generally docile in water and prefer to avoid confrontation. On land, however, they may become defensive when threatened, using their powerful jaws as protection since they cannot retreat into their shells.</p>
                
                <p>Breeding occurs from April to November, with nesting taking place in late spring and early summer. Females travel significant distances to find suitable nesting sites, often choosing sandy or gravelly areas with good sun exposure.</p>

                <h2>Threats and Conservation</h2>
                <p>Snapping Turtles face numerous threats in Ontario:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Road Mortality:</strong> Females are particularly vulnerable when crossing roads to reach nesting sites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Habitat Loss:</strong> Wetland drainage and shoreline development reduce available habitat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nest Predation:</strong> Raccoons, foxes, and other predators destroy many nests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fishing Bycatch:</strong> Turtles can drown when caught in fishing nets or on lines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Illegal Harvest:</strong> Though protected, some turtles are still taken for food or the pet trade.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Conservation efforts include habitat protection, road mitigation measures like turtle crossing signs and ecopassages, public education, and nest protection programs.</p>

            <section class="info-section">
                <h2>Legal Protection</h2>
                <p>The Snapping Turtle is listed as a species of Special Concern under both the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) and Ontario's Endangered Species Act (ESA). This means that while the species is not yet endangered or threatened, it is likely to become so if protective measures are not taken.</p>
                
                <p>It is illegal to hunt, trap, or possess Snapping Turtles in Ontario without a specific permit. The species is also protected under Ontario's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.</p>
