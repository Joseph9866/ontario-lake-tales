                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The Eastern Musk Turtle, also known as the "stinkpot," is Ontario's smallest turtle species. It has a highly domed, dark brown or black carapace (upper shell) that is often covered with algae. The plastron (bottom shell) is small and cross-shaped, providing limited protection but allowing greater mobility.</p>
                
                <p>They have a distinctive head with two light-colored stripes on each side and fleshy barbels on the chin and throat. When threatened, they release a strong, musky odor from glands near the bridge of the shell, which gives them their common name. Despite their small size, they can deliver a painful bite if handled.</p>

                <h2>Habitat and Range</h2>
                <p>Eastern Musk Turtles inhabit slow-moving, shallow waters with soft bottoms and abundant vegetation, including marshes, ponds, slow streams, and weedy bays of lakes. They prefer areas with plenty of cover such as submerged logs, leaf litter, and aquatic plants. In Ontario, they are found primarily in the southern part of the province.</p>
                
                <p>These turtles are almost entirely aquatic and rarely bask out of water like other species. Instead, they may float at the surface or climb onto submerged vegetation to thermoregulate. Eastern Musk Turtles hibernate in mud or under debris at the bottom of water bodies during winter.</p>

                <h2>Diet and Behavior</h2>
                <p>Eastern Musk Turtles are primarily carnivorous, feeding on aquatic insects, crustaceans, mollusks, worms, small fish, and carrion. They are opportunistic feeders and will also consume some aquatic vegetation. They forage mainly at night, walking along the bottom rather than swimming actively.</p>
                
                <p>They are mostly nocturnal and secretive, spending much of their time hidden in vegetation or under debris. Breeding occurs in spring and fall, with nesting in late spring to early summer. Females nest in sandy or organic soils, often in forested areas near water. Unlike most turtles, they may nest at night or during rainy weather.</p>

                <h2>Threats and Conservation</h2>
                <p>Eastern Musk Turtles face several threats in Ontario:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Habitat Loss:</strong> Wetland drainage and degradation</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Quality:</strong> Sensitivity to pollution and habitat alteration</li>
                    <li><strong>Road Mortality:</strong> Deaths when moving between habitats or nesting</li>
                    <li><strong>Nest Predation:</strong> High rates of nest destruction by predators</li>
                    <li><strong>Illegal Collection:</strong> Taken for pet trade despite protections</li>
                    <li><strong>Fisheries Bycatch:</strong> Drowning in fishing nets and traps</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Conservation efforts include wetland protection, water quality improvement, public education, and monitoring of populations. Their secretive nature makes them difficult to study, so distribution and population trends are not well understood.</p>

            <section class="info-section">
                <h2>Legal Protection</h2>
                <p>The Eastern Musk Turtle is listed as a species of Special Concern under both the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) and Ontario's Endangered Species Act (ESA). This means that while not yet endangered or threatened, it may become so if protective measures are not taken.</p>
                
                <p>It is illegal to hunt, trap, or possess Eastern Musk Turtles in Ontario without a specific permit. The species is also protected under Ontario's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. Management plans are being developed to address conservation needs.</p>
