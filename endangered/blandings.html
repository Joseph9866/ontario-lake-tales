                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The Blanding's Turtle is a medium to large-sized turtle with a highly domed, dark carapace (upper shell) covered with yellow speckles or streaks. Its most distinctive feature is its bright yellow throat and chin, which contrasts sharply with its dark head. The plastron (bottom shell) is yellow with dark blotches and has a hinge that allows partial closure of the shell.</p>
                
                <p>They have a relatively long neck and a gentle disposition. Their appearance is sometimes described as "smiling" due to the upward curve of their jawline. Blanding's Turtles are known for their longevity, with some individuals living over 80 years in the wild.</p>

                <h2>Habitat and Range</h2>
                <p>Blanding's Turtles inhabit shallow, slow-moving waters in wetlands, marshes, ponds, and slow streams with abundant aquatic vegetation. They require a complex of wetland habitats and adjacent upland areas for nesting and seasonal movements. In Ontario, they are found in scattered populations primarily in the southern and central parts of the province.</p>
                
                <p>These turtles are semi-aquatic, spending time both in water and on land. They travel significant distances between wetlands and nesting areas, making them vulnerable to road mortality. Blanding's Turtles hibernate in mud at the bottom of wetlands or under muskrat lodges during winter.</p>

                <h2>Diet and Behavior</h2>
                <p>Blanding's Turtles are omnivorous, feeding on crustaceans, insects, fish, amphibians, aquatic vegetation, and berries. They are active foragers, both in water and on land, and are known to travel considerable distances in search of food. Their diverse diet helps them adapt to seasonal changes in food availability.</p>
                
                <p>They are strong swimmers and baskers, often seen sunning on logs or banks. Breeding occurs in spring and fall, with nesting in late spring to early summer. Females nest in sandy or gravelly areas with good sun exposure, often traveling long distances from water. Blanding's Turtles have large home ranges and show strong site fidelity.</p>

                <h2>Threats and Conservation</h2>
                <p>Blanding's Turtles face serious threats in Ontario:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Habitat Loss:</strong> Wetland drainage and fragmentation</li>
                    <li><strong>Road Mortality:</strong> High mortality when crossing roads between habitats</li>
                    <li><strong>Nest Predation:</strong> Extremely high rates of nest destruction by predators</li>
                    <li><strong>Illegal Collection:</strong> Targeted for pet trade due to attractive appearance</li>
                    <li><strong>Small Population Size:</strong> Limited genetic diversity in isolated populations</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Disturbance:</strong> Recreation and development in critical habitats</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Conservation efforts include habitat protection and restoration, road mitigation (ecopassages, fencing), nest protection programs, head-starting programs, and public education. Several organizations are working to protect remaining populations.</p>

            <section class="info-section">
                <h2>Legal Protection</h2>
                <p>The Blanding's Turtle is listed as Threatened under both the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) and Ontario's Endangered Species Act (ESA). This provides significant protection, making it illegal to kill, harm, harass, capture, or possess this species.</p>
                
                <p>Critical habitat protection is required under SARA, and recovery strategies must be developed and implemented. The species is also protected under Ontario's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, with additional regulations to protect nesting habitats and prevent disturbance.</p>
